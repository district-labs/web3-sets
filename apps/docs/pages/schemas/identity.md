# Identity Web3 Set Schema

**Identity Web3 Set Schema** is a JSON Draft 07 schema for mapping objects related to decentralized identity primitives. It defines a specification for creating sets that describe behaviors, properties and state artifacts generated by Entities using the W3C [decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [verifiable credential](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) specifications.

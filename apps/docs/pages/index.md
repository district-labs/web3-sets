# ‚è£ Web3 Sets

Web3 Sets are JSON Draft 7 schemas for mapping cryptographic entities and artifacts across distributed systems.

**Schemas**
- [EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)](/schemas/schema-evm)
- [Identity](/schemas/schema-identity)

Several open source runtime engines are being developed to validate EVM and Identity sets and state artifacts.

**Runtime**
- [EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)](/runtime/runtime-evm)
- [Identity](/runtime/runtime-identity)

## Connecting the Dots

The Web3 Universe is decentralized, distributed and emergent. But it is a place where Entities interact with other Entities in predictable ways. Measurable and quantifiable events.

But we're lacking a framework to build and scale user experiences in this emergent universe. We need a way to organize and connect data in a way that is easy to understand and use.

## Approach
Web3 Sets are light-weight and flexible. Taking a simple approach to a complex problem.

Web3 Sets are instructions for verifying the cryptographic inputs and outputs of Web3 primitives.

**The approach is simple.** Everything is an Entity. Entities have predictable behaviors. Entities can be grouped into Sets. Sets can describe all past, present and future state positions, in a Web3 universe with finite entities.

**Web3 Sets draws inspiration from naive set theory.**

[Naive set theory is a way of thinking about collections of objects, called sets, and the relationships between them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory)

## Principles

Web3 Sets schemas are exclusively focused on mapping Web3 primitives with predictable and verifiable cryptographic inputs and outputs.

**Web3 Sets does not care about underlying technology or implementation details.**

Web3 Sets only care about cryptographically verifiable inputs and outputs i.e. measurable state positions.

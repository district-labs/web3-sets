# Use Cases

The use case for Web3 Sets is broad. And that's because a rules engine for the Web3 universe is applicable to a variety of products.

Web3 Set runtimes can be used stand-alone with other runtimes. For example the EVM Web3 Set schema can be used to power a transaction recommendation engine.
Or it can be used in combination with the Identity Web3 Set runtime to build a multi-environment access control gateway.

A low-level rules engine for Web3 primitives has multiple use cases.

- Transaction Recommendation Engine
- Selective Disclosure Request Standards
- Multi-Environment Access Control Gateways

It's all about what problem you want to solve. But in almost all cases a map of the world will help you.

# Set Theory

Web3 Sets derives it's approach from [naive set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory)

> Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which can be informally described as collections of objects. Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory, as a branch of mathematics, is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole.
>
> A naive theory in the sense of "naive set theory" is a non-formalized theory, that is, a theory that uses natural language to describe sets and operations on sets. The words and, or, if ... then, not, for some, for every are treated as in ordinary mathematics.
>
> In naive set theory, a set is described as a well-defined collection of objects. These objects are called the elements or members of the set. Objects can be anything: numbers, people, other sets, etc.

Web3 Sets views every resource in the Web3 Universe as an Entity i.e. object.

- Smart Contracts
- Verifiable Credentials
- Decentralized Identifiers
- etc...

**Entities** always have measurable behaviors and properties i.e. **cryptographically provable inputs and outputs.**

For example the [PoolTogether V4 USDC Prize Pool on Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x79bc8bd53244bc8a9c8c27509a2d573650a83373) deployed at the `0x79bc8bd53244bc8a9c8c27509a2d573650a83373` address is an immutable smart contract -- it will always behave in a predictable and measurable way. Producting EVM state artifacts like  transactions, logs and storage proofs, when the `Entity` is interacted with.

We can use EVM state artifacts to cryptographically verify the behavior the `PT:V4:PrizePool:USDC:Optimism` Entity and compare to a Set that describes a specific set of properties we care about.

Quantifying the behaviors of individual entities in the Web3 Universe means we can begin to create sets that describe complex, multi-environment behaviors achieved through a summation of individual Entity properties i.e. cryptographically verifiable input and output mutations grouped together to generate high-order operations and primitives.

Web Sets, in sense are describing "complex digital organisms" using low-level cryptographic primitives. 

**It's human directed evolution. But for the digital organisms.**

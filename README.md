# ‚è£ Web3 Sets

Web3 Sets are JSON Draft 7 schemas for mapping resources across distributed systems.

- [EVM Set](/schemas/evm/README.md)
- [Identity Set](/schemas/identity/README.md)
- Collection Set (Coming Soon)

Designed to be light-weight and flexible, Web3 Sets map resources across distributed and decentralized systems. Defining how to handle the Entity inputs/outputs using a basic Conditions and Rules system.

Web3 Sets are simple approach to a complex system.

**The approach is simple.**

Everything is Entity. Entities have predictable behaviors. Entities can be grouped into Sets. Sets can describe the full range of possible state positions.

**Web3 Sets draws inspiration from naive set theory.**

[Naive set theory is a way of thinking about collections of objects, called sets, and the relationships between them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory)

The only focus for the Web3 Sets schema is **Entity** mapping and applying logic operators to Entities using **Conditions** and **Rules**.

It does not concern itself with the underlying technology or implementation details. It only cares about inputs and outputs i.e. measurable state positions.
